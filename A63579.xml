            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE NARRATIVE Of the Preſent State of Affairs in SCOTLAND, Reſpecting the REBELLION: Sent in a Letter to a Perſon of Quality.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know an Account of our preſent condition muſt be acceptable to you, though the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers we now lye under may give you grief and trouble. The news of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that infeſt this our Countrey (I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not) hath gone far, and people receive the impreſſions of it according to the different paſſions that govern them. You have heard the occaſion that firſt contributed to this unhappy Rebellion, and therefore I ſhall offer nothing as to that, but only give you a ſhort Account of the great core our Magiſtrates take to put a ſtop to this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable evil; which take in a few words.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101946:2"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 26 -->
            <p>The Council omits nothing that may contribute to our ſafety; they ſit cloſe, and have iſſued forth their Orders for the ſummoning of the Militia, and all the Heritors of the next adjacent Counties to come in and attend the Kings Hoſt, which is to March againſt the Rebels; and their Orders are ſo readily and cheerfully obeyed, that it is not doubted but they will be Eight or Ten thouſand before <hi>Friday</hi> next, beſides the ſtanding Forces, which with the Addition that will be made by them, will be more Conſiderable. The Militia and Gentry of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Counties from the North are likewiſe on their March to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and may contribute greatly to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Kings affairs there.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chancellor is gone over to <hi>Fife,</hi> to haſten out the Militia Regiments, and the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of that Shire, all of whom ſeem to be very reſolute and forward for the ſuppreſſing the Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Militia-Regiment of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> have very unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly taken an Oath to be faithful to the King, and to ſerve him with their Lives and Fortunes in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, againſt thoſe who are the diſturbers of our Peace.</p>
            <p>One piece of News more I muſt likewiſe inform you of, which is very conſiderable:</p>
            <p>The Privy Council hearing that there were ſome that roſe in <hi>Tyvindale,</hi> with a reſolution to joyn with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101946:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 26 -->Rebels in the Weſt, and by that means to make them the more formidable, (which doubtleſs they would have been by the Addition of their Forces) ſent the Maſter of <hi>Roſs</hi> to <hi>Selkerk</hi> with Forty Horſe and an Hundred Dragoons to skirmiſh with, and if they could, to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them; and he behaved himſelf bravely; for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Three hundred Horſe and Foot, he Advanced towards them in good Order: The Gallantry of which Action conſternated the Rebels, who thereupon began to run. Upon which, the Maſter Commanded out Twenty of his beſt Horſe to charge them in their Reer; which effected what he deſigned, which was, to make them diſpute the point with him; for it obliged them to Halt and Draw up. Then the Maſter Attacqued them ſo briskly with his whole Party, that he killed Threeſcore upon the place, and took Ten of them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>As to the Number of theſe Rebels, we can as yet get no certain Account of them; but this we hear, and take it for a good Omen, That there are great debates and diviſions among them for the Command; and no wonder, for when Government is forſaken, and the Obligations to it denied, if every one that can, aſpires to it; and the only way to decide it, is the Swords-point; for every one may upon the ſame parity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, claim as much right to have the management of the new Government, as to endeavour the deſtruction rf the old. As to their Number, they are variouſly reported, becauſe ſome go to them, and others leave them. And my thoughts are, as they don't encreaſe, ſo they don't decreaſe.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101946:3"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 27 -->
            <p>I pray God (if it be his Will) put a ſtop to this Rebellion; and incline the hearts of the people to be obedient and loyal to His Majeſty and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there may no more Chriſtian blood be ſpilt.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time <hi>(Sir)</hi> I hope, through the Bleſſing of God, to give a further account of our ſucceſs againſt theſe diſtubers of our Peace.</p>
